# Astronomy Dashboard

## Purpose
We created this website as a means to obtain all kinds of info on astronomy into one spot. The website includes information such as weather, visibility, cloud coverage, current moon phase, constellations that are visible at this time of year, upcoming meteor showers, and the latest news in astronomy.

## Getting Started
To automatically have the website capture the user's location on load, the user must allow the browser to allow the permissions.
